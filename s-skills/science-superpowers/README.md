Science Superpowers is a complete computational-science methodology for your research agents, built on a set of composable skills plus initial instructions that make sure your agent actually uses them. It has **zero third-party dependencies** — it runs with only your agent harness and a POSIX shell.

It is a reimplementation of [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (a software-development methodology) for a different domain: doing science with data. The architecture is the same — skills that auto-trigger via a session-start bootstrap — but the workflow is the research lifecycle, and the central discipline is **pre-registration** instead of test-driven development.

## How it works

It starts the moment you fire up your agent. As soon as it sees you're trying to investigate something, it *doesn't* jump straight into running code on your data. Instead it steps back and helps you turn a fuzzy interest into a precise, falsifiable question.

Once the question is clear, it grounds the work in prior literature and standard methods, designs the analysis, and **pre-registers** the hypotheses, predictions, and decision rules *before looking at the outcomes*. That separation — confirmatory vs. exploratory, predictions locked before data — is what protects the work from p-hacking and HARKing (hypothesizing after results are known).

Then it executes the pre-registered plan in a reproducible workspace (pinned environment, fixed seeds, immutable raw data), investigates anomalies by root cause instead of quietly dropping inconvenient data, verifies every claim against fresh reproduced evidence, and red-teams the result before reporting it.

Because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your research agent just has Science Superpowers.

## The basic workflow

1. **framing-research-questions** — Activates before any analysis. Turns a rough interest into a precise, falsifiable question with hypotheses, the data needed, and what would count as an answer. Saves a question document.
2. **surveying-prior-work** — Grounds the question and chosen methods in what's already known: standard methods, known confounds, prior effect sizes.
3. **designing-the-analysis** — Breaks the work into bite-sized analysis steps with exact datasets, variables, models/tests, power, and decision rules.
4. **preregistering-analysis** — The Iron Law. Locks hypotheses, directional predictions, and decision rules — and the confirmatory/exploratory split — before any outcome is seen.
5. **setting-up-reproducible-analysis** — Isolated, reproducible workspace: pinned environment, fixed seeds, immutable raw data, clean baseline.
6. **subagent-driven-analysis** or **executing-analysis** — Carries out the pre-registered plan with review checkpoints.
7. **investigating-anomalous-results** — Activates when results look wrong. Root-cause investigation before any adjustment.
8. **verifying-results-before-claiming** — Evidence before claims: re-run, check assumptions, robustness, reproduce.
9. **requesting-red-team-review** / **receiving-critical-review** — Adversarial review before you believe or report a result.
10. **reporting-and-archiving-findings** — Reproducibility check, then write-up/preprint/iterate/shelve/discard, then archive code + data + environment.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

### Feasibility mode (opt-in)

The sequence above assumes the analysis *can* be run. When that is the open question — an unbenchmarked solver, a simulation that has never assembled at full size, a memory ceiling nobody has measured — paying for the full sequence first means writing plans and predictions for a study that may not exist.

For that case the agent will *offer* **establishing-feasibility-first**: a minimal end-to-end runner, three scaling probes against a budget whose kill criteria are proven to fire, then one exploratory campaign — deferring the survey, plan, and pre-registration until the measured answer is in.

It is **opt-in and opt-out by you alone**. The agent never enters the mode on its own initiative, never leaves it on its own initiative, and nothing produced inside it can be reported as confirmatory. Pre-registration is deferred, not cancelled: the exit gate hands back to the standard sequence at full strength, with the feasibility measurements as inputs to the design and the exploratory results as hypotheses rather than evidence.

## Example: what using it looks like

You don't invoke anything. You just talk to your agent like normal — the skills trigger themselves.

> **You:** I have last quarter's churn data. Does our new onboarding flow reduce churn?

A vanilla agent would load the CSV and start slicing. With Science Superpowers, the agent steps back first:

> **Agent:** Before touching the data, let me frame this precisely (`framing-research-questions`). The question is whether the new onboarding flow *causes* lower 90-day churn — but users weren't randomly assigned to it, so cohort and seasonality are confounders. Here's the falsifiable version, the data we'd need, and what would count as an answer…
>
> *[surveys prior internal analyses and standard methods, then designs the analysis]*
>
> **Agent:** I'm now **pre-registering** the hypothesis, the directional prediction (new flow → lower churn), and the decision rule **before** I look at any outcome (`preregistering-analysis`). Everything beyond this that wasn't pre-registered will be labeled exploratory.
>
> *[runs the pre-registered plan in a pinned, seeded, reproducible workspace; an anomaly appears]*
>
> **Agent:** One cohort shows implausibly low churn. Rather than dropping it, I'm root-causing it (`investigating-anomalous-results`) — it turns out to be a logging gap, not a real effect.
>
> *[verifies every claim against freshly reproduced output, then red-teams its own conclusion before reporting]*

The result is an analysis where the confirmatory claims are protected from p-hacking and HARKing, the anomalies were explained rather than hidden, and every number can be reproduced.

## Installation

Installation differs by harness. If you use more than one, install Science Superpowers separately for each.

### Agent Plugins (any conformant client)

This repository is a valid [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org/) v1.0.0 package — the open, vendor-neutral plugin standard. The portable manifest is `plugin.json` at the repository root, and the sixteen skills are the immediate children of `skills/`, each with its own `SKILL.md`.

Any client that implements the specification can install Science Superpowers by pointing at this repository; no harness-specific configuration is required for the skills themselves. Bootstrap hooks remain client-specific — see the sections below for the harness you use, or invoke the `using-science-superpowers` skill manually at the start of a session.

### Cursor

In Cursor Agent chat, install from the plugin marketplace, or point Cursor at this repository as a plugin. The `sessionStart` hook (`hooks/hooks-cursor.json`) loads the bootstrap automatically.

### Claude Code

Register a marketplace pointing at this repo (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) and install the `science-superpowers` plugin. The `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/hooks.json`) loads the bootstrap.

### Codex

Use the committed Codex manifest at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

### Gemini CLI

Install as an extension; `gemini-extension.json` points the context file at `GEMINI.md`, which loads the bootstrap and the Gemini tool mapping.

### OpenCode

See [.opencode/INSTALL.md](.opencode/INSTALL.md).

### Pi

Pi natively reads the same `SKILL.md` format. Install the package with
`pi install git:github.com/K-Dense-AI/science-superpowers`; the `package.json` `pi` key
registers the skills and a `before_agent_start` extension loads the bootstrap. See
[.pi/INSTALL.md](.pi/INSTALL.md).

### Google Antigravity

Antigravity natively supports Agent Skills (the same `SKILL.md` format) and reads `GEMINI.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.agent/rules/` as always-on rules at session start. Install the skills and load the bootstrap rule — see [.antigravity/INSTALL.md](.antigravity/INSTALL.md).
