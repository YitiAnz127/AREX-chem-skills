Membrane system builder orchestration.

Pipeline (Tier-A, AMBER-consistent, reuses PRISM's amb2gmx philosophy):

    orient (OPM/PPM/preoriented)
      -> bilayer construction (PACKMOL-Memgen, or a bundled Lipid21 patch)
      -> ParmEd  AMBER prmtop/crd  ->  GROMACS .top/.gro
      -> water + ions
      -> index groups, position restraints, MDPs, run script
      -> membrane MDP protocol (semiisotropic, grouped thermostats)

The bilayer itself is built by one of two routes, selected by
``config.bilayer_method`` (see :data:`BILAYER_PACKMOL` / :data:`BILAYER_PATCH`):
PACKMOL-Memgen's rigid-body pack, or deterministic xy tiling of a bundled
pre-equilibrated patch followed by KD-tree deletion of the lipids the solute
displaces.  The patch route is dry by construction, so it runs with the GROMACS
solvation route below; it falls back to PACKMOL, with a message, whenever no
bundled patch covers the requested composition.  Index groups and position
restraints are generated after solvation on both routes, because inserting water
and ions shifts every atom number they refer to.

There are two routes through the middle of that pipeline, selected by
``config.solvate``:

``packmol`` (default)
    PACKMOL places protein, lipids, water and ions in one GENCAN optimisation.
    Validated, but water is ~99% of the molecules it has to place: a class-C
    GPCR homodimer needs ~131k waters and the pack does not finish.

``gromacs`` (opt-in fast path)
    PACKMOL packs only protein + lipids (``--nocounter`` plus a near-zero
    density solvent, see :mod:`.packmol_memgen`), tleap parametrizes that dry
    system, and water/ions are then placed by ``gmx solvate``/``gmx genion``
    (see :mod:`.solvate`).  This is ~6-8x faster end-to-end -- the remaining
    cost is lipid packing, not water -- and turns "never completes" into
    "under an hour" on the systems that motivated it.

    ``gmx solvate`` fills any void its vdW radii allow, including the gaps
    between acyl tails, so the fast path is only correct because it *also*
    inflates the carbon radius AND geometrically purges whatever water still
    lands in the hydrophobic core.  Radii alone are asymptotic (they leave
    hundreds of core waters on a freshly packed, not-yet-equilibrated bilayer),
    which is why the purge is mandatory rather than a refinement.

Everything that touches an external tool is runtime-gated with an actionable
capability report, so importing/constructing the builder never fails.  The fast
path's own modules are imported lazily for the same reason: an installation
without them still builds membranes the slow way.

#: The CLI help, the MCP tool docstring and ``prism.utils.system.base`` name it
#: in prose; keep them in step when changing it.  Every consumer that needs the
#: value imports it from here rather than repeating the literal.
MEMBRANE_SYSTEM_DIRNAME = "GMX_PROLIG_MEMB"

#: Basenames of the artifacts inside the system directory.  They are constants
#: rather than literals because three independent places have to agree on them
#: -- this module, the run-script generator and the MCP build validator -- and a
#: literal repeated per call site drifts the moment one of them is renamed.
#: The three the run script also consumes are aliased from :mod:`.runscript`
#: rather than restated, so the two modules cannot drift apart: that module
#: publishes them as the membrane file-name contract (``prism.sim`` otherwise
#: assumes the soluble ``solv_ions.gro``).

#: Log of a bundled-patch bilayer build.  Named for its own route so the file in
#: the system directory says which tool actually placed the lipids.
PATCH_LOG = "bilayer_patch.log"

#: Artifacts of the patch route.  The dry PDB is what tleap is handed, and it is
#: kept: it is the only record of the geometry the patch module produced before
#: parametrisation, and the difference between "the tiling was wrong" and "tleap
#: mis-parametrized a correct tiling" is not visible in anything else.

PATCH_LEAP_IN = "leap_patch.in"

#: to parametrize before the grow-back can run.  Its lipids still overlap the
#: solute; the file says so in a REMARK and
#: :meth:`~prism.membrane.patch.DrySystem.write_parametrization_pdb` explains
#: why writing it is nonetheless sound.  Only the shrink route writes it.
PATCH_UNGROWN_PDB = "bilayer_patch_ungrown.pdb"
#: The dry system's GROMACS topology, used ONLY to drive the grow-back's
#: minimisations.  The deliverable topology is written later from the same

#: because ``grow_solute`` needs a force field before the build is finished.
PATCH_DRY_TOP = "bilayer_patch_dry.top"

#: removed once the energies have been summarised into :data:`PATCH_GROW_LOG`.
PATCH_GROW_DIR = "grow"

PATCH_GROW_LOG = "bilayer_patch_grow.log"

#: Artifacts of the solute-preparation stage that precedes the patch route's
#: tiling (see :meth:`MembraneBuilder._prepare_patch_solute`).  The prepared
#: input and tleap's completed output are both kept: the difference between
#: them IS the set of atoms that used to appear only after the lipids had been
#: chosen, so it is the evidence that the ordering bug is gone.
PATCH_SOLUTE_INPUT_PDB = "solute_for_tleap.pdb"
PATCH_SOLUTE_COMPLETE_PDB = "solute_complete.pdb"
PATCH_SOLUTE_LEAP_IN = "leap_solute.in"
#: The completed solute as AMBER parameters, and the restrained minimisation
#: run over it.  Kept for the same reason as the PDBs: the difference between

#: side chains that tleap placed on top of the rest of the protein.
PATCH_SOLUTE_PRMTOP = "solute_complete.prmtop"
PATCH_SOLUTE_INPCRD = "solute_complete.inpcrd"
#: The relaxed solute, in the order tleap's ``savepdb`` wrote the unit.
#:
#: That is NOT the order the deliverable is in.  A .gro carries no molecule
#: information, so ``system.gro`` has to list atoms in the order ``[ molecules ]``
#: expands -- whole molecules, i.e. connected components of the bond graph --
#: and on a disulfide-linked homodimer the two are wildly different: 9OMO's
#: first molecule is chain A's first segment bonded to chain B's first segment,
#: drawn from opposite ends of the file.  Measured, 11841 of this file's 24624
#: atoms sit at an index holding a different atom in ``system.gro``.
#:
#: Pairing this file with ``topol.top`` therefore yields a structure whose
#: "bonds" span the box -- 17.0 nm and 11.8 nm on 9OMO -- and mdrun aborts in
#: ``mshift``.  The name says which order it is in, and
#: :meth:`MembraneBuilder._solute_order_remarks` writes the same warning into
#: the file itself, because a name alone is a thing people skim.  It is kept as
#: evidence (the diff against ``solute_complete.pdb`` is the set of rebuilt side
#: chains) and as the structure the bilayer was built around, not as a
#: simulation input.
PATCH_SOLUTE_RELAXED_PDB = "solute_relaxed.leap_order.pdb"
#: The same solute, permuted into ``[ molecules ]`` order -- and therefore the
#: one file of this stage that DOES match ``topol.top``.  It is what the patch
#: module tiles around, so that every coordinate file downstream is in the one
#: order GROMACS reads.  See

#:
#: 100 steps of steepest descent is not a relaxation of the structure; it is

#: Measured on 9OMO: the worst non-bonded contact goes from 0.097 A to 1.362 A
#: and every contact under 1 A disappears (121 of them), while the backbone
#: moves 0.042 A on average and 1.14 A at worst -- i.e. the fold, and the
#: bilayer frame the orientation step established, are preserved.
#: ``restraintmask`` holds the backbone rather than "the atoms that were
#: already there" because AMBER masks are expressed over names, not over
#: provenance, and holding the backbone is what protects the orientation.
#: The cutoff is 9 A because sander rejects anything smaller for a
#: non-periodic run ("unreasonably small cut for non-periodic run").

SOLUTE_MIN_RESTRAINT_WT = 10.0

#: Separation (A) below which two non-bonded atoms of the same molecule are

#: deposited 9OMO coordinates have zero, and tleap's completion of them has 114.
SEVERE_OVERLAP_A = 1.0

#: Backstop on how far the minimisation may move any atom.  Deliberately loose:
#: the atoms that move furthest are the ones tleap invented, and on 9OMO the
#: largest is a backbone carbonyl at a crystallographic gap that moves 7.0 A out
#: of its neighbour (mean over all atoms: 0.073 A).  The mis-ordering this used

#:     optimisation.  The validated route, and the ONLY route for a lipid with no

#: ``patch``
#:     A bundled pre-equilibrated Lipid21 patch is tiled deterministically in xy,
#:     the oriented solute is inserted at z=0, and clashing lipids are deleted by
#:     KD-tree query (:mod:`prism.membrane.patch`).  Measured 54 s for a 315k-atom
#:     system against 17-30 min for PACKMOL's dry pack and 2.9 h for its wet pack.
#:     PACKMOL is not merely slower: at the physical area per lipid of 65 A^2 its
#:     rigid-body problem is geometrically unsolvable against its own 2.0 A
#:     tolerance, so on those systems it never converges at all.

#: G2a: how much of the requested water thickness must already be present in

DRY_BOX_WATER_FRACTION = 1.8

#: G2a, patch route: how far (nm) the dry box may differ from the cell the
#: patch route explicitly handed tleap before it is worth reporting.  On this
#: route :data:`DRY_BOX_WATER_FRACTION` answers a question nobody asked --
#: ``insert_solute`` sizes z for the *contents* plus a fixed headroom and
#: ``_normalize_box`` sizes it for the water afterwards, so a dry box smaller
#: than the water slab is the design rather than a fault.  What can actually go
#: wrong is tleap not honouring ``set SYS box``, and that is what this measures.
#: One rounding step of .gro's 3-decimal-nm precision is 0.001 nm, so this is
#: two orders of magnitude above the noise floor and only fires on a real
#: disagreement.
TLEAP_BOX_DRIFT_TOLERANCE_NM = 0.05

#: How far (nm) a single atom may lie outside a box face in the membrane plane
#: on the patch route before the wrap is considered broken.
#:
#: ``patch.tile_patch`` wraps lipids into the tiled cell *by centroid*, so a
#: molecule straddling a face keeps its far end outside it.  That is correct --
#: it is what makes the tiling periodic -- and it means the coordinate extent is
#: legitimately wider than the period by up to one molecule.  Measured on
#: mGluR7/POPC the overhang is 0.82 nm per face in x and 0.81 nm in y, i.e. a
#: little under half an extended POPC.  This bound sits at roughly 2.5x that, so
#: it cannot fire on a correctly wrapped bilayer but still catches the failure
#: that matters: a box off by a whole tile (6 nm here), which would leave a
#: vacuum stripe exactly like the one this constant was introduced to police.
PATCH_MAX_XY_OVERHANG_NM = 2.0

#: G8: the energy gate applied to the finished system.  A correctly built
#: membrane system sits far from both limits (measured LJ(SR) per atom: 1.26
#: kJ/mol for the PACKMOL path, 3.63 for the fast path with the core purge),
#: while a scrambled topology/coordinate pairing reaches ~1e11.  The gate is
#: therefore wide enough never to fire on a merely imperfect pack.

        Still cheap, but no longer manifest-only.  The manifest is an index, and
        an index is not the thing it indexes: a wheel built without package data
        can ship ``manifest.json`` and none of the ``.gro.gz`` coordinate files
        it names, in which case this returned True, ``auto`` chose the patch

        Shrink-and-grow (Wolf et al., the algorithm ``openmm.app.Modeller``
        uses) deletes lipids against a laterally shrunken copy of the solute and
        then grows the solute back, minimising the bilayer at each increment, so
        the survivors close in around it instead of being deleted out to the
        solute's full footprint.  Measured on mGluR7 it is a real improvement:
        the rim gap falls from 7.56 to 4.29 A, lipids in contact go from 13 to
        49, and the area per lipid *improves* from 64.02 to 60.62 A^2, toward
        the bundled patch's own 60.43.

        It is off by default on cost.  The grow-back is 14 GROMACS
        minimisations -- 13 short ones plus one full PME run -- and was measured
        at 821 s on 16 cores, against a ~616 s build and a stated ceiling of
        five minutes.  Turning it on by default would take a build that already
        sits at 2x the ceiling to roughly 4x it, for every user, including the
        ones who only want a system to look at.

        The case for on-by-default would be that the system is unusable without
        it, and after the box fix in :meth:`_xy_box` that is not so.  The rim
        gap is a local annulus that equilibration closes; the vacuum stripe the
        box bug left was a global fault that no equilibration recovers from,
        and it -- not the rim -- is what put the system at -5325 bar.  With the
        box correct, plain deletion delivers a bilayer that is physically sound
        at the start and merely takes longer to reach its equilibrium packing.
        That is an equilibration-time cost the user can choose to pay up front,

    # increment while the solute expands back to full size.  So the topology
    # has to exist BEFORE the grow, which inverts this route's usual order --
    # normally tleap runs on the finished geometry and that is that.
    #
    # Inverting it is sound, and cheap, for one reason each:
    #
    #   * *Sound.*  The grow moves atoms and only atoms.  It deletes nothing,
    #     adds nothing and never touches the solute (which is frozen, not
    #     restrained), and tleap infers no bond from a distance -- PRISM
    #     declares every disulfide explicitly, from solute geometry the grow
    #     leaves untouched.  So the topology of the ungrown system IS the
    #     topology of the grown one.
    #   * *Cheap.*  Because it is the same topology, the second tleap run that
    #     the naive ordering would need is not needed: the grown coordinates are
    #     written into the inpcrd the first run produced.  The only cost the
    #     grow adds beyond its own minimisations is one extra ParmEd conversion,
    #     of the dry system, to give the relaxer a .top.
    #
    # What makes the pairing safe is checked rather than assumed, in

    # Three fixes were available: re-run the deletion against the completed
    # structure and re-parametrize; complete the solute before the deletion; or

    #     the coordinates that end up in the topology, rather than against an
    #     approximation of them that is corrected afterwards.
    #   * It is the cheapest.  A re-deletion needs a SECOND tleap over the
    #     whole bilayer, because the topology has to match the new lipid set;
    #     completing first needs one tleap over the solute alone, which is a

        coordinates without looking at what is already there, so a side chain
        the crystallographer could not resolve is rebuilt straight through its
        neighbours.  Measured on 9OMO, whose deposited coordinates contain no
        non-bonded contact under 1 A at all, tleap's completion contains 114 --
        the worst being ``ILE449:CA -- ARG459:HH11`` at 0.097 A.  That is a
        protein-internal fault, so no amount of lipid deletion touches it, and
        it alone puts the finished system at +1.8e16 kJ/mol.

        A short restrained steepest descent removes them: the rebuilt tips have
        enormous forces on them and move first, while the backbone restraint
        holds the fold -- and, just as importantly, the membrane frame the

    # A .gro carries no molecule information: GROMACS pairs it with the
    # topology by position, expanding ``[ molecules ]`` in order, so every
    # coordinate file PRISM writes for this system has to be in that order.
    # ``_save_coordinates`` already does that for the deliverable, by permuting
    # the converted structure at the very end.
    #
    # The grow-back cannot wait until the end.  It minimises the bilayer
    # fourteen times *during* the build, against coordinates ``patch.py``
    # writes, and ``patch.py`` writes the solute in the order it read it.  On a
    # disulfide-linked homodimer those two orders differ in roughly half the
    # solute's atoms (measured on 9OMO: 11841 of 24624), every atom then gets
    # another atom's parameters, and mdrun aborts in ``mshift`` over bonds
    # 17 nm long.
    #
    # Rather than teach ``patch.py`` a second ordering rule -- a divergent copy
    # of an ordering rule is exactly the failure this is about -- the solute is
    # permuted into ``[ molecules ]`` order HERE, before it is handed over, so
    # everything downstream reads and writes one order and the two agree by
    # construction.  The permutation is ``_topology_atom_order``'s, the same
    # function ``_save_coordinates`` uses, applied to the solute's own prmtop.
    #
    # Two consequences worth stating plainly.
    #
    #   * The deliverable's atom order does NOT change.  ``_save_coordinates``
    #     applies the same grouping at the end either way, and grouping an
    #     already-grouped list is the identity, so ``system.gro`` comes out
    #     byte-identical in order.  What changes is the order of the
    #     intermediates -- the solute PDB, the dry bilayer PDB and the prmtop --
    #     which now agree with it instead of disagreeing.
    #   * For most inputs the permutation IS the identity.  Measured on 6KQI (a
    #     monomer whose segments are contiguous in the file) nothing moves, and
    #     the step reduces to a copy.  It only bites when a molecule's atoms are

        against the number tleap gives a residue, and tleap does not give it the
        number the PDB does.  Measured against AmberTools' teLeap: it keeps the
        FIRST residue's sequence number and then increments by one per residue,
        ignoring both the file's own gaps and the restart at a new chain.  On
        9OMO, whose two chains are each numbered 41..850, that makes chain A
        41..822 and chain B 823..1604 -- so the PDB's own numbers are neither
        unique nor what tleap answers to, and a ``bond`` built from them either
        fails outright or lands on whatever residue holds that number.

        :meth:`_write_tleap_ready_solute` therefore renumbers the solute 1..N
        before tleap ever sees it, which collapses tleap's rule to the identity
        and makes this mapping positional.  It is still computed from the file
        rather than assumed, because that is what makes the residue-name check
        in :meth:`_disulfide_bond_lines` able to catch a violated assumption.

        A key that appears more than once -- an insertion code, a chain whose
        numbering restarts, atoms of one residue split across the file -- maps
        to ``None`` so the caller refuses rather than guesses.

        The rule itself lives in :func:`packmol_memgen.tleap_residue_numbers`,
        which both bilayer routes call.  It is stated there in its general form
        (``first_resSeq + ordinal - 1``); this route's renumbering is the special
        case that collapses it to the identity, and keeping a second copy here

        The two routes disagree about what the coordinate extent means, and
        using one route's answer on the other is what put an 18.6 A vacuum
        stripe down the x face of every patch build.

        PACKMOL route -- the extent *is* the extent.  packmol-memgen packs
        molecules whole inside a constraint box and nothing is wrapped, so the
        widest atom marks the real edge of the system and the box has to clear
        it by :data:`XY_IMAGE_MARGIN_NM`.  ``max()`` against the box tleap
        reported is the right guard: it keeps a collapsed ``setBox SYS vdw``
        from cutting into the contents.

        Patch route -- the extent is meaningless and the period is exact.
        ``tile_patch`` lays down an integer number of copies of a
        pre-equilibrated patch and wraps each lipid into the cell *by centroid*,
        so a molecule that straddles a face keeps its far end outside it.  The
        cell is periodic *by construction*; the extent is simply that cell plus
        up to one lipid of legitimate overhang (measured: 20.255 nm of lipid
        across an 18.611 nm period in x, 14.092 across 12.469 in y).  Sizing the
        box to the extent therefore does not add clearance, it inserts vacuum:
        18.6 A in x and 18.4 A in y on mGluR7, a stripe with no lipid in it that
        the core-water purge then also empties of water.  Measured consequence:
        the outermost bins of the core-band density profile hold 38-118 atoms
        against a mean of 1124, and the system minimises at -5325 bar instead of
        +344 bar.  So xy is taken from the ``DrySystem`` box verbatim -- via the
        cell tleap was handed and echoed back -- and ``max()`` is not applied,
        because there is nothing here for it to protect against.

        The translation differs too.  Centring the *extent* is right when the
        extent is real; on the patch route it would drag the solute off the
        centre of the cell it was tiled around.  The raw frame is worse still --
        the mGluR7 solute sits at y = -92.1..4.0 nm, almost entirely outside its
        own box -- so xy cannot simply be left alone either.  What is centred
        instead is the solute, which is exactly ``patch._pbc_shift``'s rule and
        for its reason: the solute is the fragile molecule and must stay whole
        and inside, while the lipids are uniform, periodic and *meant* to hang
        over the faces.  ``gmx solvate`` was checked against this rather than
        assumed: handed atoms outside the box it writes them back unmoved and
        still excludes solvent from their in-box images under the minimum image
        convention, so the overhang costs nothing downstream.

        it packed, and ``setBox SYS vdw`` collapsing that onto the contents is a
        real, recoverable fault worth naming in the log.

        On the patch route that question is meaningless and the check was

        not a flag anybody passed; and the route deliberately does NOT size z
