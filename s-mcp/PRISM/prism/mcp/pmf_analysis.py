        Runs all available analyses on a completed PMF simulation:
        - SMD analysis: rupture force, work
        - Umbrella window validation: completion rate
        - Histogram overlap: sampling quality
        - PMF profile: binding free energy, barriers
        - Convergence: block averaging

        Optionally generates publication-quality plots (force, PMF profile,
