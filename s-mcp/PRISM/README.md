## Quick Start

### Protein-pocket ligand generation (experimental)

PRISM provides an orchestration layer for Pocket2Mol, TargetDiff, PocketXMol,
MolCRAFT, FLOWR, and DiffSBDD. The model environments and checkpoints are
deliberately kept outside the PRISM Python environment and run through
configured Docker, Conda, or Slurm backends.

```bash
# Validate and stage a request without launching a model
prism generate \
  --model targetdiff \
  --protein protein.pdb \
  --pocket pocket.pdb \
  --output generated_ligand \
  --dry-run

# The compatibility form is equivalent
prism --generation true \
  --model pocket2mol \
  --protein protein.pdb \
  --pocket reference.sdf \
  --output generated_ligand
```

Repeat `--model` to run several models, or use `--model all`. Pocket inputs are
interpreted by scientific meaning: PDB as a cropped pocket structure,
SDF/MOL/MOL2 as a reference ligand, TXT as a residue list, and YAML as a strict
center/residue/reference specification. Use `--pocket-kind` to make the meaning
explicit and `--reference-ligand` for models such as FLOWR and MolCRAFT.

The CLI distinguishes two generation modes and validates the shared input
before it creates the output directory:

| Mode | Models | Reference-ligand behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Direct | Pocket2Mol, TargetDiff, PocketXMol | No conditioning ligand is required. A ligand may still be supplied as `--pocket` to locate the pocket. A separate unused `--reference-ligand` is rejected. |
| Reference-guided | MolCRAFT, FLOWR | A reference ligand is mandatory. MolCRAFT accepts SDF; FLOWR accepts SDF or PDB. |

For a mixed selection, one reference ligand satisfies every selected model that
requires it; direct models continue to use the normalized pocket geometry. Run
`prism generate --list-models` to inspect the registered modes.

#### Model weights

The checkpoints are about 1 GB in total and are **not** part of the PRISM
package or repository. `prism/data/model_weights/manifest.json` records where
each one belongs, its SHA256, and its licence; the bytes are fetched on demand.

```bash
prism weights list                        # what is needed, what is present
prism weights list --verify               # re-hash everything that is present
prism weights download                    # fetch all six (~966 MiB)
prism weights download --model molcraft   # or just one
prism weights path --model molcraft       # where a checkpoint belongs
prism weights verify --model flowr        # exit non-zero if unusable
```

Weights are stored in `~/.cache/prism/models` by default (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` is
honored). Set `PRISM_MODELS_DIR` to keep them elsewhere or to point PRISM at a
tree that already exists — a shared cluster directory, for instance.

Every checkpoint comes from the [PRISM mirror](https://github.com/AIB002/PRISM_Model_Weights),
which redistributes each one unmodified under its upstream licence:

| Weights | Licence | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| TargetDiff, Pocket2Mol | MIT | attribution |
| PocketXMol, FLOWR, DiffSBDD | CC BY 4.0 | attribution |
| MolCRAFT | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | **NonCommercial**, ShareAlike |

All six licences permit redistribution, and mirroring does not relicense
anything: each artifact keeps its upstream terms, which `prism weights
download` prints as it fetches. Credit the model authors, not PRISM.

The mirror exists because the publishers are hard to fetch from. TargetDiff,
Pocket2Mol and MolCRAFT publish through Google Drive, which defeats scripted
download outright (virus-scan interstitials, per-file quotas, and no access at
all from some networks). The other three are on Zenodo, which is scriptable but
was measured at roughly 15 KB/s, against 966 MiB pulled from the mirror in
261 s (~3.7 MB/s sustained) on the same network — an eleven-hour download for
FLOWR's 600 MiB rather than under three minutes. PocketXMol is worse still at
the source: its 232 MiB checkpoint is published only inside a 611 MiB bundle.

Download integrity is enforced by SHA256 against the manifest, so a truncated
or tampered file is discarded instead of installed. Transfers resume from what
already arrived rather than restarting, which matters on a slow link: a 600 MiB
checkpoint that has to start over on every dropped connection never finishes.
Set `PRISM_MODELS_MIRROR`
to serve the files from your own host (`https://`, or `file://` for an
air-gapped cluster).

A generation run refuses to start if a selected model's weights are missing,
including under `--dry-run`, so a validation pass cannot report PLANNED for a
model that would die on a missing checkpoint.

Copy `prism/configs/generation.yaml`, enable the selected model, and configure a
wrapper command. Commands must be YAML lists (they are never passed through a
shell) and may use placeholders including `{protein}`, `{pocket}`, `{output}`,
`{reference_ligand}`, `{num_samples}`, `{seed}`, `{device}`, `{center_x}`,
`{center_y}`, `{center_z}`, and model-specific values such as `{bbox_size}`.
Pass the file with `--generation-config`.

`prism/configs/generation.local.example.yaml` is a ready-made six-model Conda
configuration with no machine-specific paths in it: it refers to the weights as
`${PRISM_MODELS_DIR}/...` and to the wrappers as `${PRISM_WRAPPERS_DIR}/...`,
and PRISM expands those two names (and only those two) when the file is loaded.

Each model writes an independent status and log directory. Valid 3D SDF records
are split into individual candidate files and also collected into
`candidates.sdf`, `summary.csv`, and `manifest.json` under the requested output
directory. A failed model does not stop the remaining selected models.

TargetDiff has the first concrete runtime contract. Start from
`prism/configs/generation.targetdiff.example.yaml`, replace the image and
checkpoint placeholders with immutable digests, and consult
`prism/generation/environments/targetdiff/README.md`. PRISM can pass a cropped
pocket PDB directly or extract one from a reference ligand, center, or residue
specification. The checkpoint SHA256 is verified before its read-only container
mount; unpinned Docker images are rejected by default.

Pocket2Mol also has a concrete Slurm runtime contract. Start from
`prism/configs/generation.pocket2mol.slurm.example.yaml` and consult
`prism/generation/environments/pocket2mol/README.md`. Its official custom-pocket
entry point requires a full protein PDB, a center, and one cubic side length.
PRISM calculates the center from a reference ligand or cropped pocket structure
and uses at least the official 23 Å box by default. A configured radius takes
precedence as a box of `2 * radius`. Pocket2Mol's official checkpoint is loaded
through a strict pickle allowlist, rewritten to a trusted per-run copy, and
verified by SHA256 before inference.

PocketXMol has a concrete Slurm runtime contract as well. Start from
`prism/configs/generation.pocketxmol.slurm.example.yaml` and consult
`prism/generation/environments/pocketxmol/README.md`. Its custom SBDD path
accepts a full protein PDB plus either a reference ligand or an explicit pocket
center. PRISM defaults to the upstream-recommended 10 Å radius for a reference
ligand and 15 Å for a center, while an explicit pocket radius takes precedence.
The wrapper uses the official model and sampler but replaces the inference
script's training-only PyTorch Lightning import with a minimal feature-dimension
bridge. The published checkpoint is verified, loaded through a strict pickle
allowlist, and rewritten inside the run directory before upstream inference.

MolCRAFT is available through
`prism/configs/generation.molcraft.slurm.example.yaml`; its runtime notes and
noncommercial/share-alike license warning are in
`prism/generation/environments/molcraft/README.md`. The public custom-pocket
path requires a PDB structure plus reference SDF. PRISM extracts center and
residue pockets before launch, reconstructs the checkpoint's embedded config
in an isolated run directory, and skips optional docking-only imports.

FLOWR is available through
`prism/configs/generation.flowr.slurm.example.yaml` and
`prism/generation/environments/flowr/README.md`. It requires a reference SDF or
PDB in this initial integration. The wrapper calls the official rigid-pocket
generator without optional protonation or interaction-recovery evaluation.
Upstream recommends about 40 GB GPU memory, so smaller GPUs may require a
single-molecule smoke test and can still be unsupported. Review the documented
upstream source/checkpoint licensing gap before redistribution.

The pinned MolCRAFT and FLOWR paths have both completed real one-molecule,
10-step GPU smoke runs on a 24 GB RTX 3090. These checks validate installation
and end-to-end SDF production; they are not throughput or quality benchmarks.

Every candidate is quality-checked before it is reported. Molecules that fail
chemically are quarantined with a written repair proposal rather than deleted
or silently corrected, because a bond order that sanitizes is not evidence it
is the one the model intended. Geometry, pose, and plausibility problems are
reported as warnings and do not withhold a molecule. Thresholds are calibrated
so that experimentally determined ligands pass with no flags.

No model emits explicit hydrogens, and parameterization does not reject such a
ligand -- it writes a topology with no hydrogens at all. Use `prism prepare-md`
to export MD-ready ligands from a finished run; it hands over only files
verified to carry hydrogens and prints the build command for them.

```bash
prism prepare-md generated_ligand -o md_inputs --only-pass --limit 10
```

prism protein.pdb ligand.mol2 -o output -ff amber14sb -lff gaff2 -w tip4p
```

**Customize system parameters:**
```bash
prism protein.pdb ligand.mol2 -o output -d 2.0 -t 300 -sc 0.1 -f
```

**Run MM/PBSA calculation:**

    -w tip4p \
    -d 2.0 \
    -t 310 \
    -sc 0.15 \
    -f
```

All shortcuts are designed to be intuitive while maintaining backward compatibility with existing scripts that use full parameter names.

## Force Field Selection Guide

### Special Features

- **Metal Ions**: Automatically recognized and handled (Zn²⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺/³⁺, Cu²⁺, Mn²⁺, etc.)
- **Protonation States**: Support for CYM, HID, HIE, HIP, CYX, LYN, ASH, GLH
- **Halogen Handling**: CGenFF lone pairs (LP) automatically removed and charges transferred

## Protein Preparation

PRISM provides advanced protein preparation with intelligent cleaning and optional protonation state optimization to ensure your protein structure is properly prepared for molecular dynamics simulations.

### Protein Cleaning

The `ProteinCleaner` class automatically processes protein PDB files with intelligent handling of metal ions and crystallization artifacts.

#### Ion Handling Modes

PRISM offers three modes for handling metal ions and heteroatoms:

- **`smart` (default)**: Keeps structural metals (Zn, Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu, Mn, etc.) while removing non-structural ions (Na, Cl, K, etc.)
- **`keep_all`**: Preserves all metal ions and heteroatoms (except water unless specified)
- **`remove_all`**: Removes all metal ions and heteroatoms

**Structural metals preserved in smart mode**: ZN, MG, CA, FE, CU, MN, CO, NI, CD, HG<br>
**Non-structural ions removed in smart mode**: NA, CL, K, BR, I, F, SO4, PO4, NO3, CO3

#### Distance-Based Filtering

Metals are only kept if they are within a specified distance from the protein:
- **Default cutoff**: 5.0 Å
- **Configurable**: Adjust via `--distance-cutoff` parameter
- **Purpose**: Removes distant, non-coordinating metals that may be crystallization artifacts

#### Crystallization Artifact Removal

Common crystallization additives are automatically removed:
- **Polyols**: Glycerol (GOL), ethylene glycol (EDO), MPD
- **PEG oligomers**: PEG, PGE, 1PE, P6G, etc.
- **Sugars**: NAG, NDG, BMA (unless covalently linked to protein)
- **Detergents**: DMS, BOG, LMT, etc.
- **Other additives**: ACT, ACE, FMT, TRS, etc.

#### GROMACS Compatibility

The cleaner automatically handles GROMACS requirements:
- **HETATM → ATOM conversion**: Metal ions are converted from HETATM to ATOM records
- **Chain reassignment**: Proteins and metals are placed in separate chains for pdb2gmx compatibility
- **Terminal atom fixing**: Automatic correction of C-terminal oxygen atoms

### Protonation State Prediction (PROPKA)

PRISM can optionally use PROPKA to predict pKa values and assign protonation states for ionizable residues (HIS/ASP/GLU/LYS/CYS/TYR) at a target pH. It renames residues in the PDB, and GROMACS `pdb2gmx -ignh` regenerates hydrogens based on those states.

#### Features

- **PROPKA integration**: pKa-based ionizable residue prediction
- **pH-based control**: Choose target pH for prediction
- **GROMACS-ready**: Residue renaming for `pdb2gmx` (e.g., HID/HIE/HIP, ASH/GLH, LYN/CYM/TYH)

#### Requirements

```bash
# Install PROPKA (required for protonation prediction)
conda install -c conda-forge propka
# or
pip install propka>=3.4.0

# Or install with PRISM protonation extras
pip install -e .[protonation]
```

#### Protonation Control

- **Method**: Choose `gromacs` (default) or `propka`
- **Target pH**: Configurable pH for PROPKA prediction (default: 7.0)

## Configuration

PRISM uses YAML configuration files for customization. Key parameters include:

- **Force fields**: Choose from AMBER, CHARMM, or OPLS variants
- **Water models**: TIP3P, TIP4P, SPC, SPCE
- **Simulation parameters**: Temperature, pressure, time, etc.
- **Box settings**: Size, shape, solvation
- **Output controls**: Trajectory frequency, compression
- **Protein preparation**: Advanced cleaning and ion handling options
- **Protonation**: Optional pKa-based protonation for ionizable residues with PROPKA

### Protein Preparation Configuration

```yaml
# Protein preparation settings
protein_preparation:
  ion_handling_mode: smart      # keep_all, smart, remove_all
  distance_cutoff: 5.0        # Distance cutoff for metals (Å)
  keep_crystal_water: false    # Preserve crystal water
  remove_artifacts: true      # Remove crystallization artifacts
```

### Protonation Configuration

```yaml
# Protonation state prediction
protonation:
  method: gromacs  # 'gromacs' (default) or 'propka'
  ph: 7.0          # Target pH for PROPKA pKa prediction
```

See `configs/default.yaml` for a complete example.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Command not found" errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and in PATH
   ```bash
   # Check GROMACS
   gmx --version
   
   # Check AmberTools (for GAFF/GAFF2)
   antechamber -h
   
   # Check Python packages
   python -c "import openff.toolkit"  # For OpenFF
   python -c "import requests"         # For OPLS-AA
   python -c "import mechanize"        # For SwissParam
   ```

2. **Force field errors**:
   - **GAFF/GAFF2**: Ensure AmberTools and ACPYPE are installed
   - **OpenFF**: Check openff-toolkit and openff-interchange
   - **CGenFF**: Verify you downloaded the correct files from the web server
   - **OPLS-AA**: Check internet connection and requests package
   - **SwissParam**: Check internet connection and mechanize package

3. **SwissParam errors**:
   - `MATCH ERROR: Could not Finish Charging`: Try `--ligand-forcefield mmff` or `--ligand-forcefield hybrid`
   - Tautomer issues: Use a different force field (GAFF2 recommended)

4. **CGenFF halogen issues**:
   - LP (lone pair) atoms are automatically removed
   - If you see LP-related errors, please report as a bug

5. **Metal ion issues**:
   - PRISM automatically detects common metal ions
   - Supported: Zn, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, Co, Ni, K, Na, Cl
   - If a metal is not recognized, it may be treated as a regular atom

6. **Protonation state issues**:
   - Ensure residues use standard names (CYM, HID, HIE, HIP, CYX, LYN, ASH, GLH)
   - GROMACS pdb2gmx should handle these automatically

7. **Protein Preparation Issues**:

   **PROPKA Not Available**:
   - **Error**: "PROPKA not found" or similar
   - **Solution**: Install with `conda install -c conda-forge propka` or `pip install propka>=3.4.0` (or `pip install -e .[protonation]`)
   - **Note**: If you do not want PROPKA, keep `protonation.method: gromacs` (default)

   **Metal Ions Removed by Distance**:
   - **Message**: "Removed ZN at distance 6.2 Å from protein"
   - **Solution**: Increase distance cutoff if metal is important: `--distance-cutoff 8.0`

   **Unknown Metal/Ion Warnings**:
   - **Message**: "Warning: Unknown metal/ion MO, keeping by default"
   - **Solution**: Add custom metal to keep list in configuration or use `--ion-mode keep_all`

   **PROPKA Renaming Summary**:
   - **Message**: "PROPKA: Renamed X residue(s)"
   - **Note**: This is expected when `--protonation propka` is enabled

   **Terminal Atom Issues**:
   - **Message**: "Fixed C-terminal residues with misplaced oxygen atoms"
   - **Note**: This is normal behavior. PRISM automatically fixes terminal atom naming for GROMACS compatibility

8. **Memory errors**: Large systems may require more RAM, especially during parameterization

### Getting Help

- Check the log files in the output directory
- Ensure input files are properly formatted (PDB/MOL2/SDF)
- Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
- Check PRISM configuration in `prism_config.yaml`
- For internet-based force fields, verify network connectivity

## CADD-Agent: AI-Driven Drug Screening Pipeline

PRISM includes **CADD-Agent**, an AI agent workflow that orchestrates a complete computer-aided drug design pipeline through [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and MCP (Model Context Protocol).

### Pipeline

```
chemblfind (1000) -> MolScope (100) -> AutoDock Vina (top 10) -> PRISM (10 MD systems)
```

| Stage | Tool | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1. Target search | [ChEMBLFind](https://github.com/AIB001/ChEMBLFind) | Search ChEMBL for bioactive molecules |
| 2. Chemical space selection | [MolScope](https://github.com/AIB001/MolScope) | Select representative molecules covering chemical space |
| 3. Molecular docking | [AutoDock Vina MCP](https://github.com/AIB001/AutodockVina_MCP) | Blind docking with AutoDock Vina |
| 4. MD system building | PRISM | Build GROMACS-ready MD systems |
| 5. Stability analysis | PRISM | RMSD, contacts, trajectory analysis |

### Prerequisites

**Python >= 3.10 required** (MCP server libraries `mcp` and `fastmcp` do not support Python 3.9).

```bash
# Create conda environment with Python 3.10+
conda create -n cadd python=3.12
conda activate cadd

# Install computational dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge ambertools openbabel
pip install vina rdkit
```

Install the 4 MCP server packages:

```bash
# 1. ChEMBLFind - ChEMBL molecule search
pip install git+https://github.com/AIB001/ChEMBLFind

# 2. MolScope - Chemical space coverage selection
pip install git+https://github.com/AIB001/MolScope

# 3. AutoDock Vina MCP - Molecular docking
pip install git+https://github.com/AIB001/AutodockVina_MCP

# 4. PRISM (this package)
pip install -e .

# 5. Claude Code (requires Node.js)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### One-Command Setup

Run (packages do not need to be fully installed first — missing ones will be reported):

```bash
prism --add cadd-agent
```

This will:
1. **Auto-detect** installed MCP server paths (Python interpreter, server scripts)
2. **Configure** `~/.claude/settings.json` with found MCP servers (global, works in any directory)
3. **Create** `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with CADD workflow trigger rules
4. **Copy** `.mcp.json` and `CLAUDE.md` templates to the current directory
5. **Report** any missing packages with install commands

### Usage

After setup, start Claude Code in any directory containing a protein PDB file:

```bash
mkdir my_project && cd my_project
cp /path/to/protein.pdb .
claude
```

Then simply tell the agent what you want:

> "I want to screen inhibitors for Riboflavin Synthase"

The agent will guide you through the full pipeline, confirming parameters at each step.

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual configuration, copy the template files from `prism/prompts/resources/`:

```bash
cp prism/prompts/resources/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
# Then edit ~/.claude/settings.json to add MCP server paths
# (see prism/prompts/resources/.mcp.json for the template)
```
